## 📂 Project Overview

This Jupyter Notebook covers:

- 🧠 **Introduction to GenAI**: Understand what Generative AI is and how it works.
- 🔌 **Integration with APIs**: Use external GenAI models via APIs like OpenAI's GPT or Hugging Face.
- 🖼️ **Text-to-Image Generation**: Generate images from textual descriptions.
- ✍️ **Text Generation Examples**: Create human-like responses using language models.
- 🛠️ **Use Cases**: Real-world applications and examples.

📸 Example Outputs

✨ Generated Text Prompt:

"Write a story about a dragon who loves coding."

✨ Output:

"Once upon a byte, in a land of silicon and sparks, lived Draco, the code-breathing dragon..."

🖼️ Text-to-Image Prompt:

"A futuristic city at night, glowing with neon lights"

📷 Output: (image example placeholder)

📌 Notes

Make sure your API keys are kept secret. Use .env or environment variables.

Outputs may vary depending on the randomness of GenAI models.

Some image generation cells may take time to run.
